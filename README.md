Hi, I'm Shivani Bharambe! 👋

Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Passionate about NLP, AI, and Data-Driven Solutions



About Me 🚀

I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 3 years of experience in data management, NLP, and software development. I hold an MSc in Advanced Computer Science (AI) from The University of Manchester, where I was honored with the Stellify Award for leadership and extracurricular contributions. At NICE Actimize, I led end-to-end data solutions for global banks, optimizing ETL pipelines and enhancing data accuracy by 98%. My passion lies in leveraging AI and deep learning to solve complex problems, with expertise in Python, SQL, and cloud technologies.





🔭 Currently working on: Building scalable AI models for text classification and data analysis.



🌱 Learning: Advanced NLP techniques, cloud orchestration with AWS, and graph databases.



💬 Ask me about: Machine Learning, NLP, ETL pipelines, or my research in app review classification.
