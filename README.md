### 🚀 About Me

MSc in Advanced Computer Science (AI) from University of Manchester. **3+ years** of hands-on experience building ML systems, data pipelines, and real-world solutions.

I don't just build models. I build *production* systems. I think about evaluation, deployment, latency, monitoring—the stuff that matters when things go live.

I'm focused on **advanced NLP projects** and documenting everything on YouTube. Every project on GitHub is something I actually built and learned from.

🔭 Currently exploring opportunities in ML engineering, applied NLP, and data science roles  
✅ MSc Dissertation: Classification of App Reviews for Requirements Engineering using Deep Learning Language Models  
🌱 Learning: Model optimization, production ML systems, and real-world deployment strategies  
💬 Ask me about: NLP, BERT, transformers, data workflows, building production ML systems, or tech in the UK  
📫 Reach me at: shivanib.work@gmail.com

### 📺 YouTube Channel

**[Shivani - ML Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/@ShivaniMLEngineering)**

I share project walkthroughs, research paper breakdowns, and real ML problems—not tutorial fluff. If you want to understand how production ML actually works, check it out.
